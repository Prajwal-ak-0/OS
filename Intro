OS 
  -> Interface between external application or softwares and the internal resources.
  -> Responsible for memory management.
  Absence of OS leads to : 
    -> Non uniform distribution of system resources.
    -> Application developers need to write the code of memory management. Leads to repetition of code and hence storage waste.
